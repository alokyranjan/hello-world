Design a simple calculator app that can handle both traditional arithmetic operations and Roman numerals

Here's a basic design for a simple calculator app handling both traditional arithmetic operations and Roman numerals:

Functionality:

Input: Allow users to input numbers (integers or decimals) and Roman numerals through buttons or a text field.
Operations: Support basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Conversion: Automatically convert Roman numerals to decimal numbers for calculations and vice versa for displaying the result.
Error Handling: Handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric characters, invalid Roman numerals) and division by zero errors with informative messages.
History: Optionally, provide a history panel to show previous calculations.
Implementation:

1. Front-end:

Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a web-based app or consider native development frameworks for mobile apps.
Design a user-friendly interface with clear buttons for numbers, operators, and Roman numeral conversion.
Implement input validation to check for valid characters and Roman numeral format.
2. Back-end (Logic):

Create functions to convert between Roman numerals and their decimal equivalents (libraries or manual implementation).
Implement functions for each arithmetic operation, ensuring correct handling of decimal point precision.
Use a stack or expression tree data structure to handle operator precedence and parentheses (if supported).
3. Conversion and Calculation:

When a Roman numeral is entered, convert it to its decimal equivalent before performing calculations.
After each operation, convert the result back to a Roman numeral if the user chooses that option.
4. Error Handling:

Display clear error messages for invalid inputs or division by zero.
Consider highlighting invalid input fields for user guidance.
5. Additional Features (Optional):

Support more complex operations (e.g., exponentiation, square root).
Implement memory functions (store, recall, clear).
Add scientific calculator features (sine, cosine, etc.).
Remember:

This is a simplified design, and the complexity can be adjusted based on desired features and technical expertise.
Focus on creating a user-friendly and intuitive interface with clear error handling.
Consider performance optimization if handling large numbers or complex calculations.
By following these guidelines, you can develop a functional and user-friendly calculator app that caters to users familiar with both traditional numbers and Roman numerals.
